I live my life by one rule, good is the enemy of great. Comfort will always keep you from being great. For that reason, I have always sought out challenges in order to grow and develop myself. I like to keep testing my limits to see how much I can achieve and how far I can go. It doesn't matter if it's in my personal life, my hobby, or my career. In whatever I do I always strive to be great and reach my full potential. When looking into my future career I wanted to work in a field where I'm challenged everyday. That's why I took the route to work in software development. I have a passion to create things that help others and the challenges that come with being a software developer will also help me reach my full potential.
